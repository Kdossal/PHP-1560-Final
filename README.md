# PHP-1560-Final

# Purpose: 
Our project aims to simulate hosptial bed occupancy for a given population over the course of 100 days. The parameters that our model takes in includes the population size, the female to male ratio, the number of beds initially available, and the community-level income. Each of these parameters contribute have a specific distribution for their length of stay, . Four dynamic visualizations are produced: the first figure illustrates the individuals currently using a bed compared to those who are waiting, the second figure illustrates average financial losses for being under/over capacity, the third figure graphs the distribution of an admitted patient's length of stay, and the fourth figure graphs the distribution of wait times for the patients in the simulation.
